# opencv-python-reference
An (almost) fully comprehensive reference for OpenCV!

**Comes with Code Snippets, Resources, Pictures (Some are animated), Explanations, Parameter Descriptions, and more!**

Sometimes it's just nice to have everything you need, all the bits and pieces of code all easily retrievable from a single source. It's like making lego bricks for your code!

I found that this kind of pre-loading of all the retrieval work makes my workflow a lot more streamlined, and I save a lot of time for the time invested into preparing these references. It also makes it so that I'm forced to read through all the documentation and understand it.

So, here's a reference that covers almost every function and functionality in OpenCV!
